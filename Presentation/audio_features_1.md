# AudioProcessor: Uncovering Insights from Video Audio

## What is AudioProcessor?

AudioProcessor is a smart tool that analyzes the audio in videos to reveal how people sound and how engaged they are. Imagine having an assistant who listens to a video and tells you about the speaker‚Äôs tone, volume, pauses, and overall energy‚Äîall in a simple, easy-to-understand format. Whether you‚Äôre a business professional, educator, marketer, or coach, AudioProcessor helps you understand the audio dynamics of your videos without any technical know-how.

## What You‚Äôll See: Clear and Actionable Results

When you use AudioProcessor, you‚Äôll get a straightforward report with the following insights, each tied to specific moments in your video‚Äôs audio:

1. **Timing (Second)**  
   - **What You Get**: The exact time in the video where each insight occurs, measured in seconds (e.g., ‚ÄúAt 3 seconds‚Äù).
   - **Why It Matters**: Timestamps let you pinpoint key moments, so you can focus on specific parts of the audio to review or improve.

2. **Pitch (Voice Tone)**  
   - **What You Get**: A measure of how high or low the speaker‚Äôs voice is, in a simple number (e.g., ‚ÄúPitch: 120.5 Hz‚Äù). Higher numbers mean a higher-pitched voice, like excitement, while lower numbers suggest a calmer or deeper tone.
   - **Why It Matters**: Pitch shows the speaker‚Äôs emotional tone, helping you understand if they sound enthusiastic, serious, or nervous at different points.

3. **Volume (Loudness)**  
   - **What You Get**: A number showing how loud the speaker is (e.g., ‚ÄúVolume: 0.25‚Äù). Higher values indicate louder speech, while lower values suggest softer or quieter moments.
   - **Why It Matters**: Volume reveals the speaker‚Äôs energy and confidence, letting you know if they‚Äôre commanding attention or speaking too softly to engage the audience.

4. **Pauses (Silent Moments)**  
   - **What You Get**: An indicator of whether the speaker is talking or pausing (e.g., ‚ÄúPause: Yes‚Äù or ‚ÄúPause: No‚Äù).
   - **Why It Matters**: Pauses show how the speaker paces their speech. Frequent pauses might suggest hesitation, while fewer pauses indicate confidence or urgency.

5. **Active Engagement (Energy Level)**  
   - **What You Get**: A score from 0 to 100 showing how engaging the speaker‚Äôs voice is, based on pitch, volume, and pauses (e.g., ‚ÄúEngagement: 85‚Äù). Higher scores mean more dynamic and captivating speech.
   - **Why It Matters**: This score summarizes how lively and engaging the speaker sounds, helping you identify moments that grab attention or need more energy.

### Example of What You‚Äôll See
Here‚Äôs a sample output from a 10-second video:
- **At 2 seconds**: Pitch: 130 Hz (enthusiastic tone), Volume: 0.3 (moderate loudness), Pause: No, Engagement: 85 (highly engaging).
- **At 5 seconds**: Pitch: 100 Hz (calmer tone), Volume: 0.15 (softer), Pause: Yes, Engagement: 60 (moderately engaging).
- **Overall**: Average engagement score of 75, with strong energy in the first half.
