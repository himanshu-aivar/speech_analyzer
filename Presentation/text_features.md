# TextProcessor: Turning Video Speech into Actionable Insights

## What is TextProcessor?

TextProcessor is an intuitive tool that analyzes the spoken words in a video to reveal how clearly and effectively someone communicates. Think of it as a smart assistant that listens to the speech, transcribes it, and provides insights about pacing, word choice, pauses, and overall engagement. Whether you’re a business professional, educator, marketer, or coach, TextProcessor helps you understand and improve communication in videos without needing any technical expertise.

## What You’ll See: Clear and Meaningful Results

When you use TextProcessor, you’ll receive a simple report with the following insights, each tied to specific aspects of the speech in your video:

1. **Transcript (Full Text)**  
   - **What You Get**: The complete text of what was said in the video (e.g., “Welcome to our training session. Let’s dive in!”).  
   - **Why It Matters**: Having the full transcript lets you see exactly what was said, making it easy to review or reference specific parts of the video.

2. **Filler Words (e.g., “um,” “like”)**  
   - **What You Get**: A count of filler words (e.g., “5 filler words used”) and details on when they occur (e.g., “Said ‘um’ at 3.2 seconds”).  
   - **Why It Matters**: Filler words can make speech sound less confident. Knowing when and how often they’re used helps you coach speakers to sound more polished and professional.

3. **Words Per Minute (Speech Pace)**  
   - **What You Get**: A number showing how fast the speaker talks, in words per minute (e.g., “120 words per minute”).  
   - **Why It Matters**: This shows if the speaker is talking too fast, too slow, or at a comfortable pace, helping you ensure the speech is clear and engaging.

4. **Pace Feedback (Speed Assessment)**  
   - **What You Get**: A label like “normal,” “slow,” or “fast” based on the speech pace (e.g., “Normal pace: 120 words per minute”).  
   - **Why It Matters**: This quick summary helps you understand if the speaker’s speed is appropriate, so you can adjust for better clarity or impact.

5. **Pace Variation (Speed Changes)**  
   - **What You Get**: A number showing how much the speaker’s pace varies (e.g., “Pace variation: 15.2”).  
   - **Why It Matters**: A varied pace keeps listeners interested. This insight helps you identify if the speaker’s delivery is dynamic or too monotone.

6. **Pace Chunks (Detailed Speech Pace)**  
   - **What You Get**: A breakdown of speech pace in 5-second segments, showing start time, end time, word count, and words per minute (e.g., “From 0-5 seconds: 30 words, 120 words per minute”).  
   - **Why It Matters**: This shows how pace changes over time, helping you pinpoint moments where the speaker speeds up or slows down, so you can improve delivery.

7. **Pauses (Legitimate and Awkward)**  
   - **What You Get**: Counts of legitimate pauses (e.g., after a sentence, “3 legitimate pauses”) and awkward pauses (e.g., mid-sentence, “2 awkward pauses”), plus details like duration and timing (e.g., “Awkward pause of 0.8 seconds at 4.5 seconds”).  
   - **Why It Matters**: Legitimate pauses enhance clarity, while awkward pauses can signal hesitation. This helps you refine pacing for smoother, more confident speech.

8. **Textual Engagement Score (Speech Impact)**  
   - **What You Get**: A score from 0 to 100 showing how engaging the speech is, based on positive/negative word use, clarity, and variety (e.g., “Engagement score: 82”).  
   - **Why It Matters**: This score summarizes how compelling the speaker’s words are, helping you create more impactful presentations, ads, or lessons.

### Example of What You’ll See
Here’s a sample output from a 10-second video:
- **Transcript**: “Welcome, um, to our training. It’s great to, like, see you all!”  
- **Filler Words**: 2 fillers (“um” at 1.2 seconds, “like” at 4.8 seconds).  
- **Words Per Minute**: 120 (normal pace).  
- **Pace Variation**: 10.5 (moderately varied).  
- **Pace Chunks**: From 0-5 seconds: 15 words, 120 words per minute; From 5-10 seconds: 12 words, 100 words per minute.  
- **Pauses**: 1 legitimate pause (1.2 seconds at 3.0 seconds), 1 awkward pause (0.6 seconds at 4.5 seconds).  
- **Engagement Score**: 82 (highly engaging, positive words like “great”).  

[Visual Timeline Example]  
- 1.2s: “um” (filler word), normal pace  
- 3.0s: Legitimate pause, positive word “great”  
- 4.8s: “like” (filler word), slight slowdown
