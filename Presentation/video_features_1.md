# VisualAnalyzer: Your Key to Unlocking Video Insights

## What is VisualAnalyzer?

VisualAnalyzer is a powerful, easy-to-use tool that automatically analyzes videos to reveal how people feel, where they’re looking, and how engaged they are. It’s like having a personal analyst who watches every moment of a video and delivers clear, actionable insights about emotions, attention, and body language. Whether you’re a business leader, educator, marketer, or coach, VisualAnalyzer helps you understand your videos without needing technical expertise.

## What You’ll See: Clear and Meaningful Results

When you use VisualAnalyzer, you’ll get a detailed report with the following insights, each tied to specific moments in your video:

1. **Mood (Facial Expressions)**  
   - **What You Get**: A description of the person’s mood at key moments, such as “happy,” “sad,” “angry,” or “neutral.” For example, “At 2.5 seconds, the person appears happy.”
   - **Why It Matters**: Knowing the mood helps you understand how people are feeling during a presentation, customer interaction, or ad, so you can adjust your approach to connect better with your audience.

2. **Eye Contact (Focus and Direction)**  
   - **What You Get**: Information on whether someone is looking at the camera or elsewhere, with a confidence score and direction (e.g., “90% confident eye contact, facing center” or “60% confident, looking down”).
   - **Why It Matters**: This shows how focused someone is, helping you gauge if your audience is engaged or distracted during key moments like a speech or interview.

3. **Engagement (Body Language)**  
   - **What You Get**: A summary of how engaged someone is, rated as “high,” “medium,” or “low,” along with a score (0 to 1) and body direction (e.g., “High engagement, score: 0.85, facing forward”). For example, “At 5 seconds, medium engagement, slightly turned left.”
   - **Why It Matters**: Engagement levels reveal how attentive someone is, so you can improve training sessions, presentations, or videos to keep your audience hooked.

4. **Emotional Tone (Overall Mood Score)**  
   - **What You Get**: A score summarizing the emotional tone, where positive moods like “happy” score +1, negative moods like “sad” score -1, and neutral moods score 0. For example, “Average emotional tone: +0.7 (mostly positive).”
   - **Why It Matters**: This gives you a quick snapshot of the video’s overall emotional impact, helping you decide if it aligns with your goals, like creating an uplifting ad or a serious training video.

5. **Timestamps (When Things Happen)**  
   - **What You Get**: Each insight is linked to a specific time in the video, like “At 2.5 seconds” or “At 5 seconds.”
   - **Why It Matters**: Timestamps let you pinpoint exactly when key moments occur, so you can focus on specific parts of the video to review or improve.

### Example of What You’ll See
Here’s a sample output from a 10-second video:
- **At 2.5 seconds**: Happy mood, strong eye contact (90% confidence, facing center), high engagement (score: 0.85, facing forward).
- **At 5.0 seconds**: Neutral mood, moderate eye contact (60% confidence, looking down), medium engagement (score: 0.60, slightly turned left).
- **Overall**: Mostly positive emotional tone (average score: +0.7), 75% of the video shows high engagement.

[Visual Timeline Example]

- 5.0s: 😐 Moderate focus, looking down
